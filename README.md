A website that displays rain clothes. These clothings are fetched from my backend, in this project i used a headless CMS wordpress.

## Description

This is my first school project ever. It is a cross course projects, that means it is constantly changing as we are learning.
At first the project was to build a website of pure CSS and HTML.
The website we were building was for a company named Rainy Days. They were a clothing company selling mainly rain proof clothing.
After we learned JS and CMS, we had to refature alot of the code we made earlier to match our current knowledge.
We also fetched information from a headless wordpress to display certain information and images about the cothing.
